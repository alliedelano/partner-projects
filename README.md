# EFL Partner & Project Management Tool
This application was developed for Edge Future Learning, an initiative of the Edge Foundation. It is a simple CRM and project management tool meant to help the team track partnership connections and partner-related projects. Once logged in through a google account, users can see a dashboard, an index of partners, and an index of projects. A user is able to add new partners and projects, view and edit details for any partner or project, as well as add comments/status updates.
